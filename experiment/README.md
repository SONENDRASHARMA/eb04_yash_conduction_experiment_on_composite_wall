### Aim
To determine the thermal conductivity of different materials from different heat input values.
### Theory
Fouriers law of heat conduction for the wall can be expressed as:
Q= -K. A .dT/dx 
Where the rate of conduction heat transfer Q and A are constant. Thus dt/dx is also constant. Which means that the temperature through the wall varies linearly with the x. That is the temperature distribution in the wall under steady condition is a straight line. Heat transfer through the plane wall of thickness L can be modeled as,
Q = KA T1-T2
        L
So the rate of heat conduction through a plane wall is proportional to the average thermal conductivity, the wall areas and the temperature difference but inversely proportional to wall thickness.
The heat conduction through the plane wall can be rearrange as,
                     Q= T1-T2
                         Rwall
Where Rwall = L
           KA
When heat conduction take place through two or more solid materials of different thermal conductivities the temperature drop across each materials depends on the resistance offered to the heat conduction and the thermal conductivity of each material.
 
Apparatus Required:
	1 Circular Electric heater
	2 circular plates of Mild Steel
	2 circular plates of Bakelite
	2 Circular plates of Wood
	Clamps and insulation 
	Voltmeter,Ammeter
	4 temperature sensors
	Temperature Indicator

### Experimental Set-up
The electric power is supplied to a circular electric heater. This electric heater will convert this electric power into thermal power(heat). On both sides of this electric heater, there exist two mild steel plates which are accompanied by plates of Bakelite and wood.The composite sections are pressed with the help of clamps. Thermocouples are placed at the center line of each junction faces to measure its temperature.Top and bottom surfaces are insulated so that heat can flow through thickness of plates only.
### Procedure
Step1: Switch on the power to electric heater and set the voltage and current values.Wait for steady state condition.   
Step2: Note down the temperature readings at different points( heater -mild  steel junction, Mild Steel-Bakelite junction, Bakelite- Wood junction , outer surface of wood)
Step3: Simulator will calculate the Thermal conductivities of all three materials based on Fourier s Law of Conduction and concepts of 1-D Steady State heat Conduction.
Step4: Change the voltage to 35 V, 40 V, 45 V, 50 V in steps and repeat steps 2 ans step 3 
Step5: After experiment is over, set dimmerstat to zero , switch off the main supply.
